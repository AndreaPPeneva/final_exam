                <h3>ANDREA PLAMENOVA PENEVA</h3>
                <p>The girl with a drive to do a lot of things....It all began with the passion of history and finding treasors, that's why she dug up a degree in ARCHAEOLOGY. Then she realized that her passion is TRAVELING, and managed to squeeeeeze in a Masters degree in that field, but thas was NOT ENOUGH and she didn't feel accomplished. So after a few  of years it all came to her - WEB DESIGN.</p>

                <p>Why you may ask...She will answer "Because I like to control what people are using in their everyday life! I would like to make people press at a link that I've placed on a certain place, and eventually to create the WOW effect."</p>

                <p class="insp-text">One lovely sunny, afternoon my father came to me, and with a gentle voice of person that is going to slip your throat, said: "Andrea think of a logo for my company!".
                And so it began..... The struggle, the pain, and the horror. But at the end, I came up with something that I would gladly change ASAP..... (although at THAT moment I was so proud with myself)</p>
