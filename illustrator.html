     <h2>INTERACTIVE PRODUCTION</h2>

<p>In the following project, I was responsible for the design of some of the elements like the city, the fire, the bang sign. I was part of a group and we all made decisions in regards to how will the entire design of the project will look like. Which parts are going to be interactive etc. We started with pen and paper and draw the entire project with the different scenes and sequence diagram:</p>

<div id="myModal0" class="modal0">
  <span class="close0">&times;</span>
  <img class="modal-content0" id="img010">
  <div id="caption0"></div>
</div>

<div id="myModal1" class="modal1">
  <span class="close1">&times;</span>
  <img class="modal-content1" id="img02">
  <div id="caption1"></div>
</div>

<p>After all the ellemts were done and the code was written and after we did a user research. And after that we managed to make some corrections and we end up making this: </p>
